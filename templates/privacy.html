<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most websites operators, Taskforce.is collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Taskforce.is’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Taskforce.is’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Taskforce.is may share non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate with organizations and employees of organizations that are members of the coalition, e.g., for example the number of visitors or signups during a particular period.</p>
<p>Taskforce.is also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users who sign up for events or register to join the coalition in an organized action. Taskforce.is only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

For example, we ask visitors who sign up to attend an event to provide an email address and phone number so that we may contact them. Those who engage in actions with Taskforce.is – by signing a petition or sending an email to Congress, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal information required to process those actions. In each case, Taskforce.is collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Taskforce.is. Taskforce.is does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
